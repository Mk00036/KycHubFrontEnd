Customer Risk Assessment System
This is a Customer Risk Assessment system built with React and connected to a backend API. It provides functionalities for viewing, editing, and filtering customer data based on their risk scores and other parameters. The application allows you to:

View a list of customers with their risk scores and statuses.

Filter customers by status.

Edit customer information including details such as name, credit score, income, and loans.

Update customer information through a modal interface, sending the data back to the backend API.

Search Functionality: Allows users to search for customers by name.

Status Filtering: Filter customers by their status (Approved, Pending, Rejected, Review).

Risk Score Visualization: A progress bar visually representing the customer's risk score with different color thresholds.

Editable Customer Details: Users can click on a customer's name to edit their details in a modal, which gets sent back to the backend upon confirmation.

Toast Notifications: Successful and failed operations trigger success and error toasts for user feedback.
